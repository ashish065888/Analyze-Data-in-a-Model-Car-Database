# Analyze Data in a Model Car Database 
This project aims at analyzing the data of a model car company called Mint Classics, drawing meaningful insights from the data and proving recommendations.

# Project scenario
Mint Classics Company, a retailer of classic model cars and other vehicles, is looking at closing one of their storage facilities. 

To support a data-based business decision, they are looking for suggestions and recommendations for reorganizing or reducing inventory, while still maintaining timely service to their customers. For example, they would like to be able to ship a product to a customer within 24 hours of the order being placed.

# Project Objective
1. Explore products currently in inventory.

2. Determine important factors that may influence inventory reorganization/reduction.

3. Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations.

--> There is no correlation between the shipping time and the number of warehouses storing the prdoucts from which the order is consist of.

# Recommendations
### Closing of the warehouse
The South warehouse has an inventory of 79380 units which is the lowest of all four and generates a second lowest revenue of $1680664 which is only $37000 more than the west warehouse.
Since the South has the lowest inventory, we can close this facility and shift the stock to other warehouses. By relocating we can increase the percentage capacity utilization of other warehouses as well.

### Inventory reduction
Based on the current average monthly units sold we can roughly estimate the number of months for which the stock will last for a particular product. </br>

We should hold an inventory that can last for 3 months and 1 month of buffer stock i.e., 4 months in total. As the demand is much higher at the year end the inventory can be recalculated based on the past years sales.

The amount that can be saved by reducing the inventory is around $29 million.

This amount can be used for Repaying any loans , Marketing purposes, improving the logistics etc.
